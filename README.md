An **AI-powered JavaScript security scanner** that detects vulnerabilities in real-time. JSGuard-AI helps you write secure code by identifying common security issues and providing actionable suggestions to fix them.

##  Features

- **Real-Time Vulnerability Detection**: Scans your JavaScript code for vulnerabilities like XSS, unsafe `eval()` usage, insecure cookies, and hardcoded secrets.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Utilizes machine learning models to provide context-aware recommendations for fixing security issues.
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis**: Performs both static code analysis and runtime monitoring.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Easily integrate into your build pipelines for automated security checks.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Offers real-time alerts in your development environment and supports popular IDEs.

##  Installation

Install JSGuard-AI via npm:

```bash
npm install jsguard-ai --save-dev
```

Or install globally for CLI usage:

```bash
npm install -g jsguard-ai
```

##  Usage

### Basic Usage

**Programmatic API**

```javascript
const { analyzeCode } = require('jsguard-ai/webpack-plugin'); // Fix typo

// Sample code to analyze
const code = `
  const userInput = getUserInput();
  eval(userInput);
`;

// Analyze code for vulnerabilities
analyzeCode(code).then((results) => {
  if (results.vulnerabilities.length > 0) {
    console.log('Vulnerabilities detected:');
    results.vulnerabilities.forEach((vuln) => {
      console.log(`- [${vuln.severity}] ${vuln.type}: ${vuln.description}`);
    });
  } else {
    console.log('No vulnerabilities detected.');
  }
});
```

**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

You can also use JSGuard-AI via the command line:

```bash
jsguard-ai scan ./src
```

Options:

--fail-on-error: Exit with a non-zero status code if vulnerabilities are found.
--severity-threshold <level>: Set the minimum severity level to report (low, medium, high, critical).

Example:

```bash
jsguard-ai scan ./src --fail-on-error --severity-threshold high
```

### Integration with Build Tools

**Webpack Plugin**

Add JSGuard-AI as a plugin in your Webpack configuration:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const JSGuardAIPlugin = require('jsguard-ai/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  // ... your existing config
  plugins: [
    new JSGuardAIPlugin({
      failOnError: true, // Fail the build if vulnerabilities are found
      severityThreshold: 'medium',
    }),
  ],
};
```
```Gulp Task
const gulp = require('gulp');
const { analyzeFiles } = require('jsguard-ai/gulp');

gulp.task('security-scan', () => {
  return analyzeFiles(['src/**/*.js'], {
    failOnError: true,
    severityThreshold: 'medium',
  });
});
```

Integration with CI/CD Pipelines
GitHub Actions

Add a step in your GitHub Actions workflow:

```YAML
- name: Run JSGuard-AI Security Scan
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: '14'
- run: npm install -g jsguard-ai
- run: jsguard-ai scan ./src --fail-on-error
```
Jenkins Pipeline

```Groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Security Scan') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install -g jsguard-ai'
        sh 'jsguard-ai scan ./src --fail-on-error'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#Configuration
JSGuard-AI can be configured using a jsguard.config.js or jsguard.config.json file in your project's root directory.

Example jsguard.config.js:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  failOnError: false,
  severityThreshold: 'medium', // Options: 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'
  rules: {
    noEval: true,
    noUnsafeInnerHTML: true,
    detectHardcodedSecrets: true,
    // ...additional rule configurations
  },
};
```
